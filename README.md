# Romero
### A 7 Days to Die settings editor and manager.

## What is Romero?
Romero is mostly a personal experiment in writing a simple Electron app. It stands for **R**_eal_ _z_**OM**_bies_ _hav_**E** _vulne_**R**_able heads._ **O**.

## What does it do?
Romero aims to make modifying your 7D2D game files a quick and easy process. It lets you...

### Apply mods
Romero streamlines the process of modifying the various xml files that control various aspects of 7D2D's gameplay. Instead of manual tweaks, all included mods can be quickly and easily applied or removed with the click of a button.

### Backup game files
You can quickly and easily backup any game files that Romero modifies, in case you run into issues or unstable xml files (for example if you mix automated and manual tweaks).

### Manage multiple installs
Have the game installed in 3 locations? Why? Well in any case, you can manage games at a per-install level.
